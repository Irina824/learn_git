          <h3>How Lebedev was almost hammered into trouble</h3>
          <p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;story about an&nbsp;avatar bug, exploited by&nbsp;the designer Artemy Lebedev. LiveJournal users uploaded large images to&nbsp;the site and then cut them using the website&apos;s settings. A&nbsp;person could take a&nbsp;photo in&nbsp;the bathroom, half-naked, and then crop&nbsp;it. Artemy exploited a&nbsp;bug that allowed the reader&apos;s full userpic to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shown in&nbsp;the post. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result

The man didn&apos;t understand how he&nbsp;deserved such a&nbsp;level of&nbsp;attention from strangers. Consequences? Artemy almost got hit in&nbsp;the face on&nbsp;the street.

Simply put, you can quickly launch <a href="[postlink id='6790']">an&nbsp;online store</a>, an&nbsp;advertising campaign, a&nbsp;corporate website, services and portals through the use of&nbsp;this CMS. All the popular functions are built into Bitrix. 1C-Bitrix&apos;s takes third place on&nbsp;the Russian internet and first place among paid CMSes. According to&nbsp;statistics, 28.7% of&nbsp;all online stores worked with Bitrix in&nbsp;2017.
      </p>
      <h3>1C-Bitrix software packages</h3>
      <p>The company offers ready-made modular solutions for various types of&nbsp;sites.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1C-Bitrix: Site Management&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;CMS for online commerce.</li>
        <li>1C-Bitrix: the Corporate Portal is&nbsp;a&nbsp;product designed for the administration of&nbsp;large companies.</li>
        <li>Industry products. Typical configurations created based on&nbsp;the Bitrix Framework: healthcare, <a href="[postlink id='6710']">a&nbsp;portal for a&nbsp;state organization</a>, a&nbsp;website for an&nbsp;educational institution, and more.
        </li>
        <li>1C-Bitrix: enterprise is&nbsp;the most expensive product designed for creating and managing very large projects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is&nbsp;the Bitrix Framework?</h3>
      <p>The Bitrix Framework is&nbsp;the core that contains various solutions and their settings. The webmaster or&nbsp;administrator can disable certain functions in&nbsp;the module, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;configure the module for the needs of&nbsp;the company. In&nbsp;addition, after buying a&nbsp;license, Bitrix offers out the source code, which allows third-party developers to&nbsp;improve the product. Therefore, any two sites on&nbsp;Bitrix can be&nbsp;strikingly different from each other. The quality and performance of&nbsp;sites using the engine directly depend on&nbsp;the experience of&nbsp;programmers and webmasters.

      <h3>4. Website redesign</h3>

      <h3>6. Adaptation for mobile devices</h3>
      <p>Mobile use on&nbsp;the Internet has reached 55-65%. Despite this, there are still sites that do&nbsp;not have a&nbsp;mobile version. Since July&nbsp;1, 2019, Google has introduced the Mobile-first indexing algorithm. The mobile version of&nbsp;the site is&nbsp;stored in&nbsp;the search index, and the relevance of&nbsp;the content in&nbsp;the output is&nbsp;determined by&nbsp;its quality.

      <h3>7. Transferring a&nbsp;site to&nbsp;1C-Bitrix</h3>
      <p>Up&nbsp;to&nbsp;30% of&nbsp;companies continue to&nbsp;use self-written websites. This is&nbsp;expensive and not always justified. Sites that started with self-written or&nbsp;simple engines want to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;content management interface&nbsp;to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>add and delete products;</li>
        <li>organize promotions;</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Bitrix takes first place among paid CMSes on&nbsp;the Russian-speaking Internet and offers a&nbsp;wide range of&nbsp;content management functionalities, so&nbsp;the transfer of&nbsp;sites to&nbsp;1C-Bitrix is&nbsp;a&nbsp;frequent request.

However, a&nbsp;year later, he&nbsp;still asked&nbsp;us to&nbsp;finalize the site. Changing someone else&apos;s code costs about the same as&nbsp;developing it&nbsp;from scratch. The customer wanted to&nbsp;save money, but in&nbsp;the end, he&nbsp;overpaid.

      <h3>8. Transferring the site from 1C-Bitrix</h3>
      <p>1C-Bitrix has a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;basic management capabilities, but still, the bundled version has a&nbsp;limited set of&nbsp;functionalities. Companies that start with a&nbsp;small online store grow into large corporations and think about their business solutions.
      </p>
      <h3>9. Integration with &lsquo;1C: Enterprise&rsquo;</h3>
      <p>1C-Bitrix provides a&nbsp;solution for integration with &lsquo;1C: Enterprise&rsquo;, which is&nbsp;configured in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;clicks. Unfortunately, the setting only works for typical 1C&nbsp;configurations. Some of&nbsp;the 1C&nbsp;configurations are atypical and part or&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the data may not be&nbsp;unloaded. In&nbsp;this case, <a href="[postlink id='6786']">improvements to&nbsp;the 1C&nbsp;modification will be&nbsp;necessary</a>.

      <h3>10. The site is&nbsp;working slowly</h3>
      <p>Stores that start with a&nbsp;dozen or&nbsp;a&nbsp;hundred products rarely experience performance problems. When the catalogue grows to&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;products, however, the site begins to&nbsp;slow down, the pages load slowly, and sometimes they do&nbsp;not open at&nbsp;all. After connecting the Sphinx search engine, which Bitrix supports out of&nbsp;the box, the site is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;work faster and with more stability.

      <h3>11. Composite website</h3>
      <p>A&nbsp;composite site speeds up&nbsp;page loading by&nbsp;two to&nbsp;three times. The page content is&nbsp;divided into static and dynamic parts. The static part is&nbsp;stored in&nbsp;the cache, and the content is&nbsp;transmitted to&nbsp;the browser almost instantly. The dynamic part, for example, the shopping cart, is&nbsp;unique for each user and is&nbsp;loaded by&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate AJAX request after the main part of&nbsp;the page is&nbsp;displayed by&nbsp;the browser.
      </p>
      <h3>12. Transfer to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new hosting</h3>
      <p>The reason for the transfer may be&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the low quality of&nbsp;the current hosting, an&nbsp;increase in&nbsp;the load, changes in&nbsp;<a href="[postlink id='8732']">SEO optimization</a>, or&nbsp;legal requirements.
      </p>
      <p>Few people will be&nbsp;pleased by&nbsp;the frequent interruptions in&nbsp;the work of&nbsp;the site associated with the hosting provider&apos;s equipment. Therefore, we&nbsp;are asked not only for the transfer itself but also for the selection of&nbsp;a&nbsp;suitable hosting. The best hosting companies offer tariffs specifically for Bitrix.
      </p>
      <p>As&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;visitors increases, the load on&nbsp;the hardware also increases, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not enough to&nbsp;increase the current tariff plan&nbsp;&ndash; a&nbsp;fully-fledged transfer to&nbsp;a&nbsp;dedicated server is&nbsp;necessary. For large projects under the &lsquo;Enterprise&rsquo; license, the &lsquo;Web Cluster&rsquo; module is&nbsp;provided, which allows one to&nbsp;host a&nbsp;site on&nbsp;several servers.
      </p>
      <p>If&nbsp;an&nbsp;online store or&nbsp;a&nbsp;site has a&nbsp;regional affiliation, for example, it&nbsp;sells goods only in&nbsp;St. Petersburg, then it&nbsp;is&nbsp;better to&nbsp;place the site in&nbsp;a&nbsp;data centre in&nbsp;the same city. The site pages of&nbsp;the target audience will load faster, and search engines will increase the relevance in&nbsp;the output for regional queries. Therefore, when the company starts working on&nbsp;SEO optimization, we&nbsp;suggest moving to&nbsp;the best hosting.

      <h3>14. SEO audit</h3>
      <p>Before optimization, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;conduct an&nbsp;audit of&nbsp;the customer&apos;s site to&nbsp;find out how they are currently seen by&nbsp;search engines. Also, it&apos;s important to&nbsp;roughly estimate the amount of&nbsp;upcoming work in&nbsp;capital. To&nbsp;audit the site, the &lsquo;SEO module&rsquo; and &lsquo;Web Analytics&rsquo; are used.
      </p>
      <h3>15. Technical audit</h3>
      <p>A&nbsp;technical audit of&nbsp;the site should be&nbsp;carried out after the move to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new hosting, after a&nbsp;redesign or&nbsp;after changes to&nbsp;the structure of&nbsp;the site. The goal here is&nbsp;to&nbsp;identify errors, such as&nbsp;broken links, duplicate pages, lack of&nbsp;meta-information on&nbsp;the page, etc. Yandex.Webmaster and the Google Search Console are able to&nbsp;show problematic pages.
      </p>
      <h3>16. Usability audit</h3>
      <p>Usability directly affects the competitiveness of&nbsp;the site.

If&nbsp;the site is&nbsp;inconvenient to&nbsp;use, a&nbsp;potential client may select a&nbsp;competitor.

With its help, we&nbsp;can establish the relationship between site visitors and the target audience, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the adequacy of&nbsp;the company&apos;s pricing policy. Based on&nbsp;the results of&nbsp;this analysis, we&nbsp;shall be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;write strategies for further work.

      <h3>18. A/B testing</h3>
      <p>When changing the page design or&nbsp;adding new features, A/B testing is&nbsp;carried out to&nbsp;determine the attitude of&nbsp;users to&nbsp;the innovation. Users are divided into groups&nbsp;A and&nbsp;B: some see the old version of&nbsp;the page, while others see the new one. This is&nbsp;how the impact of&nbsp;changes on&nbsp;conversion and behaviour can be&nbsp;evaluated. When the update is&nbsp;implemented, it&nbsp;becomes available for everyone. Starting with the Small Business Edition, the A/B Testing module is&nbsp;included in&nbsp;the bundle.

      <h3>19. Setting up&nbsp;goals</h3>
      <p>Setting up&nbsp;goals in&nbsp;Yandex.Metrica and Google Analytics helps to&nbsp;track the chain of&nbsp;user actions, from entering the site to&nbsp;placing an&nbsp;order. This allows one to&nbsp;visualize where users are encountering problems.
